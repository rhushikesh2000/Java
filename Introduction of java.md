### History of JAVA

-----

 The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of java starts with Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.

The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted and Dynamic".
James Gosling - founder of java

Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. There are given the significant points that describe the history of Java. 

1) James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.

2) Originally designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.

3) Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and file extension was .gt.

4) After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.

### Why Java named "Oak"?

---

5) Why Oak? Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.

6) In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.

### Why Java Programming named "Java"?

7) Why had they chosen java name for java language? The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell and fun to say.

According to James Gosling, "Java was one of the top choices along with Silk". Since Java was so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.

8) Java is an island of Indonesia where first coffee was produced (called java coffee).

9) Notice that Java is just a name, not an acronym.

10) Initially developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.

11) In 1995, Time magazine called Java one of the Ten Best Products of 1995.

12) JDK 1.0 released in(January 23, 1996).


**Why Use Java?**
---

As mentioned above, Java is a high-level language and should be studied if you want to know the basics of programming. Let us learn why there is a need to learn the language.

1. Object-Oriented

\- Java is a true object-oriented language, where everything is treated as an object. This fosters modular and reusable code through concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. Platform Independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere)

\- Java achieves platform independence by compiling source code into an intermediate bytecode, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This allows Java programs to run on any platform with a compatible JVM, eliminating the need for recompilation.

3. Multi-Threading and Concurrency Support:

\- Java supports multi-threading and concurrency, allowing developers to create and manage multiple threads of execution. This is crucial for building responsive and efficient applications that can perform tasks concurrently.

4. Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection) 

\- Java's garbage collector automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation. It identifies and collects objects that are no longer referenced, preventing memory leaks and manual memory management errors.

**Java Development Kit (JDK)**
---

As the name formally states, Java Development Kit is a full-time kit that has a compiler, Java Runtime Environment(JRE), Debuggers, and Java documents included in it. For further execution in Java, we need to have JDK installed on our computers to further lead to the creation, compilation, and running of the Java program.

Here, as we use JDK, we need an environment to run the programs. We use JRE Java Runtime Environment, which provides the least requirements to execute the Java program. It provides the JVM, Core classes, and supporting files.

**Java Run-time Environment (JRE)**
---

JDK includes JRE, which, in turn, after installation, allows the Java program to run. But we still can't compile it. It has a browser, the applet supports, and a few plugins included in it. So, to run a java program on your respective computers, you need JRE.

**JRE is made up of multiple elements altogether, and they are:**

1. Java virtual machine (JVM)
2. Java class libraries
3. Java class loader

**Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**
---

It is a very important part not only of JDK but also JRE as it is inbuilt in both of the places. When you run a program using the JRE and JDK, it also goes to the JVM as it is required to run the java program and interprets the program. 

**Run the Code**: JVM runs the bytecode provided by the compiler. Since Java is a platform-independent language, the compiled code produced by the JAVAC compiler is converted to machine code using platform specific JVMs. Different platforms have different JVMs. JVMs convert the bytecode into platform specific machine code.


**Bytecode in the Development Process**
---

The source code provided to the JAVAC compiler that is present in JDK gets compiled into a bytecode that the JVM can execute. It gets saved as a .class file by the compiler itself. We can also view this bytecode using a disassembler like javap.
