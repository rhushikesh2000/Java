**Introduction of Java**
 ---
 
 Java is a class-based object-oriented simple programming language. Though we can not consider it to be fully object-oriented as it supports primitive datatypes. It is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that helps programmers and developers to write code once and run it anywhere.

**What  is Java programming ?**
 ---
Java is a programming language that James Gosling developed at Sun MicroSytems\_Inc in the year 1995, which later on was taken into possession by the Oracle Corporation in 2009.

1. We can call it a high-level (makes the development of programs easy and much more user-friendly) programming language, making it very convenient for us to write, compile and debug Java programs.
2. Java is a class-based object-oriented programming language that implements the principle of writing one code anywhere.
3. Since Java applications are compiled to byte code, they can run on any JVM-supported machine.
4. Java codes are very similar to C/C++, which makes them easier to understand.

**Why Use Java?**
---

As mentioned above, Java is a high-level language and should be studied if you want to know the basics of programming. Let us learn why there is a need to learn the language.

1. Object-Oriented

\- Java is a true object-oriented language, where everything is treated as an object. This fosters modular and reusable code through concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. Platform Independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere)

\- Java achieves platform independence by compiling source code into an intermediate bytecode, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This allows Java programs to run on any platform with a compatible JVM, eliminating the need for recompilation.

3. Multi-Threading and Concurrency Support:

\- Java supports multi-threading and concurrency, allowing developers to create and manage multiple threads of execution. This is crucial for building responsive and efficient applications that can perform tasks concurrently.

4. Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection) 

\- Java's garbage collector automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation. It identifies and collects objects that are no longer referenced, preventing memory leaks and manual memory management errors.

**Java Development Kit (JDK)**
---

As the name formally states, Java Development Kit is a full-time kit that has a compiler, Java Runtime Environment(JRE), Debuggers, and Java documents included in it. For further execution in Java, we need to have JDK installed on our computers to further lead to the creation, compilation, and running of the Java program.

Here, as we use JDK, we need an environment to run the programs. We use JRE Java Runtime Environment, which provides the least requirements to execute the Java program. It provides the JVM, Core classes, and supporting files.

**Java Run-time Environment (JRE)**
---

JDK includes JRE, which, in turn, after installation, allows the Java program to run. But we still can't compile it. It has a browser, the applet supports, and a few plugins included in it. So, to run a java program on your respective computers, you need JRE.

**JRE is made up of multiple elements altogether, and they are:**

1. Java virtual machine (JVM)
2. Java class libraries
3. Java class loader

**Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**
---

It is a very important part not only of JDK but also JRE as it is inbuilt in both of the places. When you run a program using the JRE and JDK, it also goes to the JVM as it is required to run the java program and interprets the program. 

**Run the Code**: JVM runs the bytecode provided by the compiler. Since Java is a platform-independent language, the compiled code produced by the JAVAC compiler is converted to machine code using platform specific JVMs. Different platforms have different JVMs. JVMs convert the bytecode into platform specific machine code.


**Bytecode in the Development Process**
---

The source code provided to the JAVAC compiler that is present in JDK gets compiled into a bytecode that the JVM can execute. It gets saved as a .class file by the compiler itself. We can also view this bytecode using a disassembler like javap.
